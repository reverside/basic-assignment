# Basic Assignment

#### Objective:
Objective of this level, is to ensure that we can deliver a quality solution using a programming language following standard practices.

#### Tools & Technology :

##### Language :
* Java
* C#

##### Source Code Management :
* git (Java & C#)

##### Build Tool :
* maven (Java)
* dotnet CLI (C#)

##### Unit Test:
* JUnit (Java)
* xUnit (C#)

#### Commonly Done Mistakes
* Do not create the project with any IDE, initial project must be created using build tools like maven or dotnet CLI.Later on you can import the project to any IDE for rapid development. But the project must be created with a build tool and one should be able to build the project with only the build tool without any IDE.
* Don't distribute your code as files/folders attaching to an email, rather put your source code on any cloud based git server (like github) and share the source code as a link to your respository.
* Don't keep the files/folders generated by IDE or generated during build process in git, rather ignore them using .gitignore. Only those files/folders should be kept in repository which are necessary to build the code after a fresh checkout.
* Give a proper name to the project and must use a relevant namespace for your project following standard naming convention
* Don't all logic inside main method, rather keep main method in a separate class at the root package level and should just instantiate a class and call one of its method
* Don't keep all your logic in one class/method , rather design it with following OOPS concepts and Single Responsibility Principles.
* Name all packages, classes, methods and variables following standard naming convention suggested by the language community and must be consistent.
* Each public method in a class containing logic should have corresponding unit tests to cover all scenarios.
* Possible exception scenarios must be analyzed and handled appropriately and must have unit tests for them.
* One should be able to build and run the application using the build tool/SDK from a command prompt, without using any IDE. Example: Build Tool -> maven, dotnet CLI, SDK -> JDK, .net Core SDK
* Project structure must follow standard build tool suggested structure (maven/dotnet CLI)and should be made clean and simple as much as you can.
* Must provide a README.md file formatted with github format, at the root of the project documenting how to build and run the project
* README.md file must mention the tools/softwares need to build and run the project with version information
* Proper access specifier must be mentioned, like member variables must be private, methods not invoked must be private/protected
* Methods should not lengthy, rather split it into smaller methods appropriately
