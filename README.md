# Basic Assignment

#### Objective:
Objective of this level, is to ensure that we can deliver a quality solution using a programming language following standard practices.

#### Tools & Technology :

##### Language :
* Java
* C#

##### Source Code Management :
* git (Java & C#)

##### Build Tool :
* maven (Java)
* dotnet CLI (C#)

##### Unit Test:
* JUnit (Java)
* xUnit (C#)

#### Commonly Done Mistakes
* Don't create the project with any IDE, initial project must be created using build tools like maven or dotnet CLI. Later on you can import the project to any IDE for rapid development. But the project must be created with a build tool and one should be able to build the project with the build tool without any IDE. Project structure must follow standard build tool suggested structure (maven/dotnet CLI) and should be made clean, simple and meaningful as much as you can. Must follow standard practices while working with your scm tool.
* Don't distribute your source code through email, rather put your source code on any cloud based git server (like github) and share the source code as a link to your respository. Don't keep the files/folders generated by IDE or generated during build process in git server, rather ignore them using .gitignore. Only those files/folders should be kept in repository which are necessary to build the code after a fresh checkout. Must provide a README.md file formatted with github format, at the root of the project documenting how to build and run the project and the minimal tools/softwares needed (with version number) to build and run the project on a new machine.
* Standard naming convention must be followed through out the project like project name, namespace, classes, methods, varaibles etc. Proper access specifier for members must be used and must keep the source code clean and properly aligned. Dont keep anything unused or not required. Every word, line, file you keep in your source code must have some significance and you must understand what this is for and why it is required. 
* Don't all logic inside main method, rather keep main method just as an entry point to start your application. Don't keep all your logic in one class/method , rather design it with following OOPS concepts and Design Principles. Possible exception scenarios must be analyzed and handled appropriately. Methods should not lengthy, rather split it into smaller methods appropriately. 
* You must have a test module for unit testing as prescibed by the build tool. You must use the mentined test libraries for your unit tests. Each public method in a class containing logic should have corresponding unit tests to cover all scenarios. You may skip unit tests for DTO classes, which generally contains getters and setter for its properties. Both positive and negative scenarios must be covered as a part of your unit tests.

###### NB:
Above are some basic rules which must be followed. But you must learn more detail about them and read upon standard practices & clean code to apply in your project. And you must know the minimal basics and apply best practices in your project with all the above tools and technologies mentioned.
