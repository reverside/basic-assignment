Problem Statement :
===================
I have a business with branches all over south africa. And  I receive data of new customers from the branches/offices 
every week. Currently, I have branches at Pretoria, Johannesburg, Capetown. And they send new customer data as a file
through email in differenet format. 

I need those customer data to be inserted into my database table called "CUSTOMERS" with columns like id, first_name, last_name, gender, date_of_birth, marital_status. So I want you to develop a console based tool which can be used to 
generate necessary sqls out of a file to insert the data into database. 

I am not expecting the tool to execute the sqls into my database, rather just generate the insert statements into a file, so that I can exeute them in the database manually using any database tool. Please note that I may get new branch in future, which may send data in a new format, so with minimal change we should be able 

Requirement Details :
=====================
Develop a console based application, which can take a file name and a sequence number as command line argument
and should be able to generate a sql file out of it and the application should be executable from command prompt 
as below, assuming that sample_capetown.txt is in the current directory.

C#   -> Application.exe sample_capetwon.txt 500
Java -> java -jar application.jar sample_capetown.txt 500

Input file will contain new customer data in one of the formats as described below and name of the input file should 
be in the format <any_text>_<branch_name>.txt Example : sample_capetown.txt, test_johannesburg.txt, abcd_pretoria.txt 

Below are the same data for 2 customers, but with different formats, and the expected output sqls provided. 
Expected output is same for all the 3 formats as same 2 customer data is used for all the 3 formats.
